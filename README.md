# Wave-Function-Collapse-6D
Wave function collapse simulation in python using panda3d for visualizations. 

W, A, S, D and mouse to move around regular 3d space<br>
Arrow keys to move in A, B dimensions and +, - to move in C dimension.<br>
Esc to allow regular mouse movement. <br>

As shown in the image below, the A, B, and C dimesion position is located on the screen<br> 
and currently the range is 1 to 3 with increments of 1 (whole numbers).

Currently, there's a whole lot of verticies being drawn, since each 3d piece is being<br>
generated with 1x1x1 cubes, which in turn amplifies the number of verticies being drawn.

Plan on moving to a model based system to reduce number of verticies drawn instead of<br>
manual vertex manipulation and because I'd like to to see the pieces look more smooth than blocky
